# Fractional Numbers

13.75 base 10 to set to another base break it up into 13 and 0.75 then compute.
13 = 1101 and 0.75 = 0.11 as (75 is 110)

**converting base 8 to base 16 has shortcuts same with base 4**

**0x in code mean hexadecimal**

# Negative Numbers

-> how negative is stored is the number is stored as is and then another digit is stored to define if number is negative.

**done in notebook** 

whether sign goes first or last that  will depend on design decisions there are some use cases for going after but usually first

# Storing large numbers
when adding large numbers they may exceed size of base. That is called overflow.

tens compiment is same as nine but add 1
