# Twos compliment
**VERY IMPORTANT--> done in notebook **

0 0000
10001
2 0010
3 0011   
4 0100
5 0101
6 0110
7 0111
-8 1000    ----> every possible for 2s compliment in 4bit
-7 1001
-6 1010
-5 1011
-4 1100
-3 1101
-2 1110
-1 1111

first row is 2^8      ---> number changes every 8 numbers down the row
second row is 2^4 
third row is 2^2 
last row  is 2^1 

--> 7 is 0111 if you want -7 with 1s compliment it is 1000 (switch every value)
--> **IMPORTANT in 2s compliemt it is 1001 as it is the same as 1s but add one so.**

--> every column is a wire in computer 

A ----> [                       ] -----> S
B ----> [  Adder table   ] -----> C
C ----> [                       ]

# Multiplication

**DONE IN NOTEBOOK**
## Negatives

**Positive × Positive: Normal Multiplication 
Negative × Positive: Normal Multiplication (make sure to sign extend correctly) 
Positive × Negative: Flip left and right and multiply as above 
Negative × Negative: Two’s compliment both left and right and multiply results**

---> should always be number x positive number.

## BOOTHS Algorithm(not on exams)

if u want to multiply 1111 it can be written as 10000 - 00001.

**not on midterm or final**

# Division

**done in notebook**
# Floating point and fixed point arithmetic(STUDY)

what we are used to is fixed point.

3.4 x 10^6 --> become a sign bit - exponent bit - mantissa bit (number 3.4)
